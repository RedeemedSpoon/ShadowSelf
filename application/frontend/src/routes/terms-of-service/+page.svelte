  <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
  <p>
    These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and Shadowself ("Us"). Your access to and use of the
    Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
  </p>

  <h3>Description of Service</h3>
  <p>
    Shadowself ("the Service") is a web application designed to empower users in protecting their online privacy and anonymity. The
    Service enables the generation and management of synthetic digital identities. These identities are configurable and may include
    elements such as temporary phone numbers, virtual payment card details (for authorized use), temporary email addresses, proxy
    service integration, and generated personal data attributes (e.g., names, nationalities). The primary purpose of the Service is to
    provide users with tools to manage their digital footprint when registering for and interacting with third-party online services
    and related activities.
  </p>

  <h3>User Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    To access certain features of the Service, you may be required to create an account. You are responsible for safeguarding your
    account credentials (username and password) and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us
    immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that are inactive for an
    extended period or are found to be in violation of these Terms.
  </p>

    provide at least 7 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect, which may be provided by posting the new terms on the Website
