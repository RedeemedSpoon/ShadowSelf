  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <h6>Gotta agree to our rules first, then we can get started!</h6>

    <p>
      <span>TLDR</span> Basically, don't use Shadowself for illegal stuff (or at least don't get caught). You're responsible for how you
      use it, and we're not liable if something goes wrong. If you break the rules, you're on the hook.
