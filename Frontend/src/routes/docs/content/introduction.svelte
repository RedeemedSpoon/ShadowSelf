<p>
  Welcome to the ShadowSelf API documentation. We are pleased to offer programmatic access to the core functionalities of the
  ShadowSelf platform, allowing developers and users to integrate our synthetic identity management tools directly into their own
  applications, workflows, and systems.
</p>
<p>
  This API is designed following <b>RESTful principles</b>, ensuring predictability, ease of use, and compatibility with standard HTTP
  practices. You can expect to interact with it using conventional HTTP methods (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>,
  <code>DELETE</code>, etc.), receive standard HTTP status codes indicating success or failure, and exchange data primarily in JSON
  format. Our goal is to provide an API that feels familiar and adheres to the best practices commonly found across modern web
  services, facilitating a smooth integration experience for developers of all skill levels.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you are looking to automate identity management, build custom tools on top of our platform, or simply prefer interacting via
  code, this API provides the necessary endpoints and functionalities.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
  The primary purpose of the ShadowSelf API is to <b>empower users with programmatic control over their synthetic identities</b>. While
  our web-based dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing personas, we understand the need for automation, integration,
  and more advanced control that only an API can offer.
</p>
<p>Key objectives of this API include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Programmatic Management:</b> Create, retrieve, update, and delete synthetic identities and their associated attributes (like phone
    numbers, emails, etc.) directly through code, bypassing the manual dashboard interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Automation:</b> Enable the automation of repetitive tasks related to identity management, such as rotating identities based on specific
    triggers or integrating identity creation into larger automated workflows.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Integration:</b> Facilitate the seamless integration of ShadowSelf's capabilities into third-party applications, custom scripts,
    or specialized tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Flexibility and Openness:</b> Offer developers the flexibility to build custom solutions tailored to their specific needs, fostering
    innovation and extending the utility of the ShadowSelf platform. We believe in openness and providing the tools necessary for users
    to interact with our service in the way that best suits them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ease of Use:</b> Provide a straightforward and well-documented interface that allows developers to quickly get started and effectively
    leverage the power of ShadowSelf programmatically.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Essentially, the API serves as an alternative and complementary way to interact with your ShadowSelf account, designed for
  efficiency, automation, and custom integrations.
</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>
  The ShadowSelf API opens up a variety of possibilities for developers and advanced users. Here are a few concrete examples
  illustrating how you might leverage the API:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Real-time Event Monitoring:</b> Utilize potential WebSocket connections (if offered via the API) or polling mechanisms to listen
    for specific events related to your identities. For instance, you could build a notification system that alerts you immediately when
    a new message or call is received on one of your synthetic phone numbers or email addresses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Custom Email/Messaging Client:</b> Develop your own specialized client application to manage communications associated with your
    ShadowSelf email aliases. This could offer a tailored user interface, advanced filtering capabilities, or integration with other communication
    tools, providing a more powerful alternative to generic clients or the web dashboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Extending Account Management:</b> The API enables you to build custom tools to manage these stored credentials programmatically.
    You could, for example, create scripts for bulk importing/exporting credentials, integrating with other secret management systems, adding
    new fields or developing custom interfaces for accessing this stored login data beyond our standard dashboard.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just illustrative examples. The API provides the building blocks for you to create innovative solutions tailored to your
  privacy, security, or automation needs.
</p>

<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>
  As you utilize the ShadowSelf API, please be mindful that the platform is maintained with <b>limited resources</b>. We ask that you
  interact with the API responsibly by <b>avoiding spamming requests</b> or implementing overly aggressive polling, ensuring your
  integrations are efficient to minimize server load. Currently, we operate on a principle of <b>mutual respect and trust</b>,
  foregoing strict rate limits.
</p>
<p>
  We trust our users to use the API fairly, allowing us to maintain an open environment. However, please understand that we reserve the
  right to implement limits or block traffic if necessary to protect service stability for everyone. Your considerate usage helps us
  keep the API accessible.
</p>
